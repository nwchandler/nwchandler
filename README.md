> _Practicing the craft of systems software._

I'm a systems engineer drawn to the foundations of modern computing: operating systems, networking, compilers, and distributed systems. I strive to be a **Systems Toolsmith**: someone who draws from multiple domains to solve general problems by building reusable tooling for myself and others.

I study how low-level software behaves by building small, reproducible experiments and tools. Much of what you'll find here reflects that practice.

## Guiding Principles

I work from a few core principles:

- Make simple things simple and complex things possible. (_Shout out to Alan Kay_)
- Favor clarity, correctness, and simplicity over cleverness.
- Code should teach as much as it executes.

## Current Focus

- Operating system internals
- Compilers and language runtimes

## Writing

I maintain a [blog](https://nickchandler.dev) that serves as a working notebook: posts, lab notes, and experiments focused on systems behavior and design reasoning.

## Connect

I'm always open to thoughtful conversations about the craft of building reliable systems and the tools that support them.
